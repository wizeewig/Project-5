# Meme App
This is my **Fifth Android Project**. It is a meme app. It **displays meme** with the help of an **api call**. One can also **share** the meme through various social media such as Whatsapp, FB, Telegram etc.
In this project I have learned about using **Progress Bar**, **JSON Object Request Volley** and **Glide Library**.
